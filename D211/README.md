# D211: Advanced Data Acquisition
Advanced Data Acquisition enhances theoretical and SQL skills in furthering the data analytics life cycle. This course covers advanced SQL operations, aggregating data, and acquiring data from various sources in support of core organizational needs. 

## Competencies
### Explore Data
The graduate explores data acquisition.
### Advanced SQL Operations
The graduate applies advanced SQL operations to integrate multiple data sources.

## Performance Assessment
The data analyst’s job does not end once the data has been analyzed. A vital skill for data analysts is to represent and report the data to stakeholders. In this task, you will demonstrate your ability to identify actionable insights from data and communicate them using effective storytelling methods.

#### This task consists of three parts:

In part 1, you will use SQL and a business intelligence tool to create data dashboards to support executive decision-making. Your dashboards should enable leaders to answer a specific research question on an organizational need. It is recommended, but not required, that the business intelligence tool be Tableau.

Your dashboard will integrate data from two sources:

1.  Provided data set: You will select one of the data sets and associated data dictionaries from the web link "D211 Data Sets and Associated Data Dictionaries" located on Labs on Demand.

2.  Additional data set: You will identify an external, public data set as an additional data set for your dashboard. This data set should contain data and variables that complement the data set you chose from the provided options and should enhance the insights you can gain from the provided data set. Recommended sources include U.S. census data, Kaggle, or other public data repositories. You are responsible for ensuring that you have the rights to use the data set.

In part 2, you will give a simulated presentation to a panel of peers. You will describe the use of SQL in preparing the data from the two data sets for the analysis and then demonstrate the functionality of the SQL scripts and other codes that supported the creation of the dashboards.

In part 3, you will write a reflection paper to outline the organizational need and summarize the findings from the analysis.
