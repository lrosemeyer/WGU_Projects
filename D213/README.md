# D213: Advanced Data Analytics
Advanced Data Analytics prepares students for career-long growth in steadily advancing tools and techniques and provides emerging concepts in data analysis. This course hones the mental and theoretical flexibility that will be required of analysts in the coming decades while grounding their approach firmly in ethical and organizational-need-focused practice. Topics include machine learning, neural networks, randomness, and unconventional data sources.

## Competencies
### Constructing Neural Networks
The graduate builds neural networks in the context of machine-learning modeling.
### Time Series Analysis
The graduate applies time series models in generating forecasts.
### Natural Language Processing
The graduate extracts insights from text data using effective and appropriate natural processing (NLP) models.

## Performance Assessment
As a data analyst, you will assess continuing data sources for their relevance to specific research questions throughout your career.

In your previous coursework, you have performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on your data. You have seen basic trends and patterns and now want to start building more sophisticated statistical models. In this course, you will use time series modeling. We will explore time series models and their implications.

After you choose your organizational data set, you will review the data dictionary and considerations related to the raw data file you have chosen and prepare the data for time series modeling. You will then analyze that data set using time series modeling, create visualizations, generate forecasts, and deliver the results of your analysis.
