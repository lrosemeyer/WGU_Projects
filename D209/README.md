# D209: Data Mining I
Data Mining I expands predictive modeling into nonlinear dimensions, enhancing the capabilities and effectiveness of the data analytics lifecycle. In this course, learners implement supervised models—specifically classification and prediction data mining models—to unearth relationships among variables that are not apparent with more surface-level techniques. The course provides frameworks for assessing models’ sensitivity and specificity.

## Competencies
### Classification Data Mining Models
The graduate applies observations to appropriate classes and categories using classification models.
### Predictive Data Mining Models
The graduate implements prediction data mining models to find hard-to-spot relationships among variables.
### Data Mining Model Performance
The graduate evaluates data mining model performance for precision, accuracy, and model comparison.

## Performance Assessment
In this task, you will act as an analyst and create a data mining report. In doing so, you must select one of the data dictionary and data set files to use for your report from the following link: Data Sets and Associated Data Dictionaries.

You should also refer to the data dictionary file for your chosen data set from the provided link. You will use Python or R to analyze the given data and create a data mining report in a word processor (e.g., Microsoft Word). Throughout the submission, you must visually represent each step of your work and the findings of your data analysis.
