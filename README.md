# WGU Projects
This repository contains projects that I completed on my way to receiving my masters degree in Data Analytics from Western Governors University. This included projects using SQL, R, and Python.

## Machine Learning
- D208
- D209
- D212

## Neural Networks
- D213 Task 1

## Natural Language Processing
- D213 Task 2

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
- [Data Imputation](https://github.com/lrosemeyer/WGU_Projects/tree/main/D206): For this project, I used R to impute missing values into columns to effectively clean my dataset. I decided to use MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) for imputation because it would keep the distribution of each variable the same as before imputation.
