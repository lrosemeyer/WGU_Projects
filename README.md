# WGU Projects
This repository contains projects that I completed on my way to receiving my masters degree in Data Analytics from Western Governors University. This included projects using SQL, R, and Python.

## Machine Learning
- [Multiple Linear Regression](https://github.com/lrosemeyer/WGU_Projects/tree/main/D208/Multiple%20Linear%20Regression): I used R to perform multiple linear regression to determine a patients income based on multiple health factors.
- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/lrosemeyer/WGU_Projects/tree/main/D208/Logistic%20Regression): I used R to perform logistic regression  to determine the chances a customer will churn based on services that they have purchased.

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
- [Data Imputation](https://github.com/lrosemeyer/WGU_Projects/tree/main/D206): I used R to impute missing values into columns to effectively clean my dataset. I decided to use MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) for imputation because it would keep the distribution of each variable the same as before imputation.
- [Hypothesis Testing](https://github.com/lrosemeyer/WGU_Projects/tree/main/D207): I analyzed data in R using measures of central tendency, correlation, and variation. Then, I conducted a T-Test to determine if a higher number of tech support contacts leads to a higher churn rate.
