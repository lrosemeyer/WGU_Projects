# D208: Predictive Modeling
Predictive Modeling builds on initial data preparation, cleaning, and analysis, enabling students to make assertions vital to organizational needs. In this course, students conduct logistic regression and multiple regression to model the phenomena revealed by data. The course covers normality, homoscedasticity, and significance, preparing students to communicate findings and the limitations of those findings accurately to organizational leaders.

## Competencies
### Logistic Regression
The graduate employs logistic regression algorithms in describing phenomena.
### Multiple Regression
The graduate employs multiple regression algorithms with categorical and numerical predictors in describing phenomena.
### Regression Implications
The graduate makes assertions based on regression modeling.

## Performance Assessment
As a data analyst, you will assess continuous data sources for their relevance to specific research questions throughout your career.

In your previous coursework, you have performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on your data. You have seen basic trends and patterns and now can start building more sophisticated statistical models. In this course, you will use and explore both multiple regression and logistic regression models and their assumptions.
