# D212: Data Mining II
Data Mining II adds vital tools to data analytics arsenal that incorporates unsupervised models. This course explains when, how, and why to use these tools to best meet organizational needs.

## Competencies
### Clustering Techniques
The graduate applies clustering techniques to accurately predict outcomes of interest.
### Dimension Reduction Methods
The graduate implements dimension reduction methods to identify significant variables.  
### Pattern Prediction
The graduate predicts patterns in data using association rules and lift analysis.

## Performance Assessment
In this task, you will act as an analyst and create a data mining report. In doing so, you must select one of the data dictionary and data set files to use for your report from the following link: Data Sets and Associated Data Dictionaries.

You should also refer to the data dictionary file for your chosen dataset from the provided link. You will use Python or R to analyze the given data and create a data mining report in a word processor (e.g., Microsoft Word). Throughout the submission, you must visually represent each step of your work and the findings of your data analysis.
### Scenarios
#### Scenario 1

One of the most critical factors in customer relationship management that directly affects a company’s long-term profitability is understanding its customers. When a company can better understand its customer characteristics, it is better able to target products and marketing campaigns for customers, resulting in better profits for the company in the long term.

You are an analyst for a telecommunications company that wants to better understand the characteristics of its customers. You have been asked to use principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze customer data to identify the principal variables of your customers, ultimately allowing better business and strategic decision-making.

#### Scenario 2

One of the most critical factors in patient relationship management that directly affects a hospital’s long-term cost-effectiveness is understanding its patients and the conditions leading to hospital admissions. When a hospital can better understand its patients’ characteristics, it is better able to target treatment to patients, resulting in more effective cost of care for the hospital in the long term.
