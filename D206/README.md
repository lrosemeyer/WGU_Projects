# D206: Data Cleaning
Data Cleaning continues building proficiency in the data analytics life cycle with data preparation skills. This course addresses exploring, transforming, and imputing data as well as handling outliers. Learners write code to manipulate, structure, and clean data as well as to reduce features in data sets.

## Competencies
### Predicting Obstacles in Data Analysis
The graduate predicts potential obstacles in data analysis based on the quality of data provided.
### Preparing Data for Analysis
The graduate prepares data for analysis to address organizational needs.
### Manipulating Data for Analysis
The graduate writes reusable code to manipulate and clean data in preparation for analysis.

## Performance Assessment
In a previous course you used SQL methods to collect data for analysis and to support decision-making processes. The next step involves preparing the data for analysis, a process known as data cleaning. You will explore various graphs and statistics to identify outliers, consider various methods to handle missing data, such as imputation, and explore a basic use of principal component analysis (PCA) for data reduction of a set of variables.

To complete this assessment, you will use raw data from the industry of your choice and prepare the data set for analysis. You will also create visualizations and deliver a clean data set ready for exploratory analysis.
